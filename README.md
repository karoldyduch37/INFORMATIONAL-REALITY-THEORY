# Informational Reality Theory (TRI)  
### by Karol Dyduch (2025)

This repository contains the foundational framework of a new physical theory — the **Theory of Informational Reality (TRI)**.  
It proposes that the Universe is built not from particles or fields, but from dynamic *informational relations* between elementary units called **ubits**.

## 🔍 What is TRI?

- A relational model of reality based on information, not substance  
- Space, time, mass, motion and energy emerge from **relational structure**  
- All phenomena result from **changes in entanglement and fluctuation**

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Ubit** – smallest unit of relational information  
- **Relaton** – localized informational tension (acts like a particle)  
- **Psi (Psi)** – index of fluctuation (disorder of relations)  
- **Alpha (alpha)** – entanglement flow constant  
- **Effective light speed** varies with fluctuation density

---

## 🚀 Status

This repository serves as **proof of authorship and public disclosure**.  
It is the starting point for simulations, experimental models and future technologies built on TRI.
